## Scenarios

The included AMIs built with this default repository consist of:

- Broken Nginx
- Broken Apache
- Broken Python Web App
- Broken Ruby Web App
- Broken Bash Script

### Broken Apache

This scenario is intended to provide a candidate with the opportunity to demonstrate their familiarity with Systemd, Apache and a basic web application.  They must determine why the web application is not operational, drilling down into why a service works.  Once a candidate has been able to resolve the first few issues, they must then determine why the web application isn't appearing externally.

### Broken Python Web App

This scenario is intended to provide a candidate with the opportunity to demonstrate their familiarity with Python tooling.

### Broken Ruby Web App

This scenario is intended to provide a candidate with the opportunity to demonstrate their familiarity with Ruby tooling.
